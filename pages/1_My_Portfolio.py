             On top of this, it was also Warren Buffet who mentioned that hardly anyone is able to consistently beat the S&P 500 index, something that still stands true to this day.
             Investing into the VOO fund, provides me with exposure to 500 biggest companies in the United States, without the need for active management.
             Something that has been constantly emphasised throughout my study in Finance, is the need for diversification.
             Ensuring that your portfolio is exposed to a diverse range of sectors and companies, shields you against unsystematic risks meaning extreme events have less of an impact on your portfolio.""")

    After conducting my own research, I decided to choose SCHD due to its low cost and choice of reputable companies within its portfolio. Within its fund, \
    it consists of companies that have proven to have a reliable dividend track record, with many belonging to the Dividend Aristocrats selection, which are companies within \
    the S&P500 index that have increased and paid their base dividend for at least 25 consecutive years.""")
